<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>=C2=A0is simply dummy text of the printing a=

ummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of ty=

um.</p>

<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the re=
adable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lor=
em Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as o=
pposed to using &#39;Content here, content here&#39;, making it look like r=
eadable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now =
use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#39;lorem ip=
sum&#39; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versio=
ns have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose=
 (injected humour and the like).</p>

<p>=C2=A0</p>

<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It ha=
s roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over=
 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney Co=
llege in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectet=
ur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in =
classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes =
from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&qu=
ot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book =
is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.=
 The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, c=
omes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced bel=
ow for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de Finibus=
 Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact orig=
inal form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. =
Rackham.</p>

<h2>Where can I get some?</h2>

<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the =
majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or rand=
omised words which don&#39;t look even slightly believable. If you are goin=
g to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn&#39;t anyt=
hing embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generat=
ors on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making t=
his the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over =
200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to g=

erefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic=
 words etc.</p>
